**ThreeFold Impact - A digital empowerment initiative**    
  
  
# 1. Introduction 
## 1.1 ThreeFold Impact 
ThreeFold Impact (“TFI”) facilitates the expansion of ThreeFold Grid, a decentralised, neutral, green and secure internet (i.e. storage and computing capacity) in emerging economies with underdeveloped internet infrastructure and limited access to digital services.     
  
Local and affordable internet give better access to education, digital services and critical needs assistance, i.e. create necessary conditions for continuous development and integration into the global digital economy. Poor connectivity and disproportionately expensive storage and computing capacity result in a vicious cycle of isolation and subpar growth for emerging economies. We believe that such areas need comprehensive support in attaining a sustainable digital presence and integrating with the global economy.     
  
TFI solution is to finance local individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses in setting up and operating ThreeFold Farms, eco-friendly alternatives to the traditional data centers, which can be economical even at a microscale, and without significant brick and mortar infrastructure (e.g. electricity grid or fiber optic broadband).     
  
Storage and computing capacity of the ThreeFold Grid are rolled out by independent individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses via ThreeFold Farms, internet capacity producers. ThreeFold Farms are an eco-friendly alternative to traditional data centers. They can be as big as a hyperscale data center, or as small as a modem-size box and still be economical due to ThreeFold’s innovative software technology and the use of blockchain for network regulation. The small boxes produce enough capacity for several users and can be run from home. A network of such small boxes forms a decentralized internet, local to and owned by all. ThreeFold entrepreneurs, or ThreeFold Farmers, farm and earn ThreeFold Tokens, the currency of this new internet. ThreeFold tokens are green, because they use proof of capacity, i.e. tokens are created when Farmers connect their box to electricity and the internet. In other words, no electricity is burned for complex-algorithm problem solving. In fact, ThreeFold software uses less electricity than traditional data centers.     
  
  
Threefold Foundation is the sponsor of TF Impact, providing TF Tokens to those who farm TF capacity by connecting to the TF Grid.    
## 1.4 ThreeFold Impact Africa
ThreeFold Impact Africa is our first initiative to improve Africa’s internet capacity and access thereto, thereby supporting innovation and entrepreneurship and levelling the playing field for education and inclusivity.     
  
Our goal is to develop and accelerate the farming of ThreeFold internet capacity in Africa, and thus lower the cost of computing and storage capacity for the region. ThreeFold Impact Africa finances  local individuals and businesses in the startup process of farming Threefold internet capacity.    
## 1.5 ThreeFold Impact Africa Founders & Participants
ThreeFold Impact Africa (“TFI Africa”) delivers financial return plus measurable social impact by financing the deployment of storage and computing capacity in one of the most underdeveloped regions, Africa. .     
  
TFI Africa has the following mandate:    
Empower individuals, businesses and communities through increased connectivity, digital literacy and access to digital and critical needs services in Africa 
Supporting a more equitable peer-to-peer economy
Promote environmental sustainability.

# 2. ThreeFold Impact Platform
ThreeFold Impact facilitates connectivity, inclusion and prosperity in Africa by financing local entrepreneurs, who establish and run capacity farms, empowered by ThreeFold technology. ThreeFold Impact has an inbuilt give-forward to the communities, where its capacity farms operate. The goal of the give-forward is to improve digital literacy, increase access to digital services and access to critical needs assistance.     
  
ThreeFold finances local entrepreneurs, who set up and run ThreeFold capacity farms, which produce local storage and computing capacity, an alternative to overseas based data centers.     
  
The returns to ThreeFold Impact investors are capped at a pre-agreed multiple to the initial investment, with the excess returns redeployed into the social responsibility projects.    
  
  
ThreeFold Impact promotes accessibility, inclusion and local and global community betterment via expansion and utilization of its green grid of data and compute capacity. Key to it’s focus, Threefold Impact has a built in giveforward, direct social impact component, included by design, in all its initiatives.    
  
The primary social impact component is achieved by deploying returns, in excess of pre-agreed capped return, back to communities within the country from where the returns have been generated. Additionally, ThreeFold Impact has purpose built CSR initiatives based upon direct matching and sponsorship of Threefold capacity.    
  
TFI gives back via three types of social projects: education and digital literacy, accessibility of digital services and critical needs assistance.     
## 2.1. ThreeFold Impact Instruments
  
TFI finances several types of Farmers: individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses.     
  
TFI finances ThreeFold individual and entrepreneur Farmers by purchasing hardware and extending working capital facilities. The ThreeFold Farmers set up and operate the farms on behalf of TFI, earn ThreeFold tokens for providing the services until the hardware fully depreciates (60 months) or TFI recovers its investment plus target return, whichever happens earlier. At that point ownership of hardware is transferred to the Farmer. The Farmer can run the software for an additional period of up to 5 years - ThreeFold technology can be run on the refurbished hardware with comparable economics.         
  
L    
ThreeFold Impact has two primary instruments:    
  
- Impact Invest: enables large scale grid expansion by means of investing in infrastructure at an attractive return for investors with a built-in giveforward/Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) component. Returns to investors are capped at a multiple of initial investment whilst excess returns are reinvested for social impact.
     
- Impact Empower: enables socially responsible initiatives based upon direct matching of sponsors and beneficiaries and includes all give-forward activities (i.e sponsor matching, community/crowdfunding + CSR social investment). Sponsors are empowered to support TFI pre-approved project beneficiaries directly by means of TFT (Threefold Tokens)  donations or infrastructure sponsorship. Further, on behalf of Impact Invest, Impact Empower oversees partnerships and social investment of CSR funds (excess returns) and invests in social impact for individuals and communities.
  
These two core TFI instruments fall within the two main sub-circles according to their function and objectives, as follows:    
  
  
  
By design, all TFI initiatives include a “giveforward” social impact component. **Impact Invest** achieves this by re-investing excess returns back into the community via CSR funds and hence the two subcircles are interlinked to denote that **Impact Empower** is the intended instrument through which the excess returns generated from **Impact Invest **would be redistributed.    
## 2.2. ThreeFold Impact Initiatives
Within these two core TFI instruments are the initial launch efforts as envisaged by the team.    
  

    
### 2.2.1 TFI INVEST
An **Impact Invest** initiative. Investors enable the expansion of compute and data capacity infrastructure via the deployment of the Threefold grid primarily in emerging markets for both a financial and a social impact return. Excess returns after a pre-set ROI cap are reinvested via the **Impact Empower** initiatives or via pre-qualified 3rd party CSR partner initiatives.    
### 2.2.2 TFI Match 
An **Impact Empower** initiative. **TFI Match** is intended to match sponsors to pre-approved beneficiaries to enable them in becoming ThreeFold Farmers. Sponsors donate TFT (ThreeFold Tokens) or capacity to empower specified beneficiaries (individuals,groups or organizations) for a social impact return only. The beneficiary farmer receives full financial return from all farming activity.    
### 2.2.3 TFI COMMUNITY 
An **Impact Empower** initiative. **TFI Community** is intended to enable any TFT holder to make a donation of TFT directly to TFI pre-approved beneficiaries via a ThreeFold e-wallet in the name of the beneficiary. Beneficiaries are pre-qualified by ThreeFold Impact against specific criteria and then “promoted” on the TFT app via a directory of eligible recipients to whom any TFT owners can be a sponsor.       
### 2.3 TFI Beneficiaries (of financial support)
#### 2.3.1. Financially Assisted Farmers:
Any pre-qualified individual or group as a prospective farmer who meets the investment criteria of TFI to receive financial support from TFI in establishing their farming initiative. Funding allocated to such a recipient is specific to the financing of the farming capacity itself and not the operational elements of the farming business per se.    
#### 2.3.2. Financially Sponsored Farmers:
Any pre-qualified individual or group as a prospective farmer who is selected by a sponsor to be a recipient of farming capacity through a co-op or of a pre-configured node    
#### 2.3.3. Social Impact Partners
TFI gives forward  by investing in local social impact provider partners- proven third party not-for-profit, non-governmental organizations with established track records of efficacy, and a high level of community engagement and good standing.    
# 3. TFI Investment Criteria

## 3.2. IMPACT INVEST CSR: Partner selection criteria
Impact Invest’s give-forward CSR funds achieve social impact in key target sectors by partnering with established Social Impact Partners (SIPs).     
  
SIPs may be local, regional, national or international organizations with significant operations in the target region. SIPs must be registered public benefit not-for-profit organizations in good legal standing with a proven track record of no less than 5 years of success in implementing effective social impact projects with significant measurable outcome. Eligible partner’s proposed projects demonstrate clearly defined outputs and indicators, baseline data, risks, and risk management.    
  
Project activities that fall within TFI social impact target areas, are relevant, realistic and contribute toward the overall TFI defined social impact goals:    
  
- access to sustainable technologies
- literacy & education
- capacity building in digital or economic literacy
- solutions in environmental sustainability 
- economic and/or community empowerment
  
Project budgets are in line with activities, key actors have adequate previous experience of project management in the same sector, and the beneficiaries of the partner’s activities have been consulted and participate in the design of the projects (high level of community engagement/ meet critical community need). Partners demonstrate equality, high levels of community participation and inclusion, accountability and transparency in planning, implementation and monitoring of their projects.    
## 3.3. IMPACT EMPOWER: Beneficiary selection criteria
Includes TFI:Match & TFI:Community. Impact Empower’s direct donor matching initiatives and community give-forward platform are guided by the principles of good faith and trust.    
  
Inspired by Marion Rockefeller’s trust-based Flow Funding in which proven social actors are empowered to give forward to their communities, Impact Empower facilitates direct donor support of beneficiaries to enable individuals and groups to benefit from becoming Threefold farmers. Our Threefold Impact Directory allows potential farmers and interested donors to register their proposals and find one another in a direct match-giving platform. 
Ref:[ http://flowfunding.org/about/whatisit.html](http://flowfunding.org/about/whatisit.html)  
  
Eligible beneficiaries for Impact Empower are individuals or registered community groups who are able to fulfill the requirements of a Threefold Farmer (diy or enabled via a co-op, see: [Role of a TFF Co-op](https://docs.grid.tf/threefold/info/src/branch/master/concepts/what_does_a_cooperative_do.md)) and are willing to the agree to the terms of the Goodwill farming agreement (TBD).    
# 4. ThreeFold Impact Tools (proposed)
## 4.1. TFI Give-Forward wallet 
Allows all participants in the Threefold eco-system to allocate social-impact resources to a list of TFI pre-approved beneficiaries (CSR partners or farmers) with a dedicated wallet in their name and advertised on the TFT app.     
## 4.2. Threefold Impact Directory (TID)
Matching for Impact: A directory for donors & investors & TFI to link to beneficiaries, partners and projects.    
  
- Impact Provider Partners are able list their projects- needs, structure, social impact projections
- Beneficiary farmers looking for sponsors list their requests (type, location, rationale, plan for use of return, etc).
## 4.3. Risk factor calculator
To calculate risk on specific projects, i.e longevity, partner success rate, amount of local/ other investment, structure of the deal requested by the partner, etc.    
## 4.4. Impact Tracker
Successfully matched donors/beneficiaries and investors/projects above can be presented in a platform that shows the progress of farming and of projects, benchmarks met, etc. This can be integrated with Social suite and IXO (see below)    
# 5. TFI MEASUREMENT
## 5.1. Investment Returns Measurement
xxxx    
## 5.2. Social Impact Measurement:
## Qualitative Assessment
Donors and beneficiaries, investors and partners, participate in feedback and reporting on their activities.    
## Independent third party assessment:
IXO: Results of social impact investment will be assessed via IXO, the world’s first blockchain protocol for impact measurement- a decentralised impact exchange to verify impact claims, i.e. ’proof of impact’.    
  
Socialsuite: an SaaS platform with a digital marketplace of validated impact measurement metrics that helps not-for-profits and community service organisations measure and report on the outcomes and impacts of their services.    
# 6. TFI Legal Structure
The legal structures and entities as proposed by Sinews Global in response to TFI’s intentions are shown in the schema below:    
  
<img class="mdexporter-image" src="assets/image_0.jpeg" alt="" height="456" width="624">
  
The legal structures shall be aligned on the type of business being carried out and shall be created in jurisdictions allowing for such type of business to be carried out without hindrance and/or complexities. The final set up will therefore cater for the financial and contractual inputs and outputs in a most appropriate manner. To further the defining of same and to set the exact types of entities and legal structures, it is necessary to have clear examples and descriptions of the following:-    
## 6.1 Investor perspective. 
As an investor, small or large, what are the considerations, commitments, terms, etc. relating to the transaction proposed and what is provided in return, whether it be a token (certificate) or financial returns. Usually, an investor would like to reach comfort as regards the type of investment considered and the risks associated to same. As well as mentioning the potential upsides, it is recommended that all the downside risks be disclosed clearly to the investor prior to the transaction as well as in the contract proposed. That way, all and any risks of claims in terms of potential losses are covered beforehand and mitigation of claims is successfully dealt with. Ie. If I am told that there is a risk of losing my money altogether in the process, I should then take the care of investing only money that I can afford to lose.    
## 6.2 Management perspective. 
Clearly demonstrating and illustrating the purpose and destination of the investment to be managed, how it will be managed, where and how finances and operations will be managed. In essence, the people involved in management of a fund will be individuals with a high level of educational and professional credentials and appropriate investment managerial experience. Investors will usually look for long-term, consistent fund performance with a fund manager whose tenure with the fund matches its performance time period.  The main benefit of investing in a fund is about entrusting the investment management decisions to the professionals. The quality of the fund manager or management will be one of the key factors to consider when analyzing the investment “quality”, hence this “quality” should be present in all the management and investment decisions from outset, and such should be fully recorded and demonstrated to be “in the interests” of all stakeholders. Therefore, the asset management will consist of a systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, and disposing of assets in a most responsible manner.    
## 6.3 The “Investee” perspective.
The investees, in this context, will be companies that will be given money in order to make a profit or to derive an advantage based on same. We need to look closely at the parameters, rules, commitments, and/or covenants that the Investees will have to commit to, as well as their responsibilities towards the management described above. The investment part of the equation and management thereof will have to take a close interest in their investee companies and in some cases manage same closely too. This must be clearly defined from outset as the same set of rules, be there two or three different investment options, as discussed, must apply to all investees in a linear manner so as not to run into “tailored” difficulties at a later date.    
# 7. TFI Blockchain Integration 
Threefold Impact is a blockchain-enabled Impact investment initiative and it is our vision that all TFI products would ultimately be administered via smart contract.    
## 7.1 Smart Impact Bond (SIB) 
SIB’s are very new with the inaugural SIB only having launched January 2018 but do seem very promising, ie. “innovative financing mechanisms that require multiple parties to be coordinated, incentivized and held accountable through contractual agreements.” However, the literature notes that basis of SIB’s is still distrust:    
  
*“In a game-theoretic sense, the parties are set up to play adversarial roles that keep the actors honest. This is achieved through a system of incentives and penalties that are adjudicated by trusted parties. Financial incentives are used to promote the participants to be good actors. Legally enforceable penalties are put in place as disincentives for bad actors or poor performance.  Performance conditions are established for payments to be *    
*triggered and these mechanisms must be trustworthy. Triggers typically rely on predefined measures being met, based on verifiable evidence, which usually requires acceptable quality data that is independent audited.”*    
  
Whilst we should be learning as much as we can about SIBs, perhaps a new smart contract modelled on the SIB concept but based more on trust rather than penalties and incentives. The TFI SIIA- a *proposed* innovative trust-based contract    
## 7.2 Smart Impact Investment Agreement (SIIA)
Question/ proposition: Could we design a new type of agreement that is based on win-win- set goals with rewards that are motivational and not punitive? We can explore the possibility of creating a SIB type smart contract but based on trust and imbued with the flexibility needed to support local projects where both grid expansion and social impact are needed most.    
  
Often projects out rolling in deep development contexts, rural communities and places with a less stable environment (political, environmental, economic,) even very well thought out and conservative benchmarks can be missed due to factors out of the control of the local partners.     
The SIB/ SIIA we use should have if-then type of caveats built in to the contract.    
  
**SIIA Parameters:**    
- multiple parties
- same timelined benchmarks as SIBs
- based on zero-sum (Nash- cooperation over competition) rather than an adversarial role/ penalty and disincentive basis.  
- pre-defined outcomes set and measured funds dispersed based on meeting of pre-set benchmarks
- incentive for good actor status
- verifiable evidence is data on the performance of the farm or project 
- the level of the farmer’s/ partner’s investment in their own hardware and operations is used as proof of intent/ goodwill, and as one of several factors in calculating risk. 
- outlines parameters such as distribution/ liquidation of assets and allocation, exit strategy
  
SIIA enables investors/sponsors & community to match themselves via the TID portal and invest in projects directly through smart contracts, (SIB or SIIA). Any fees applicable for the commissioning of any service (vetting, contracts, measurement, reporting), would be integrated into the smart contract and executed accordingly    
  
*Simple, direct, disruptive, decentralized.*    
  
Question: Can this be done, and for which type of investors?    
- Sponsors/ donors only
- Impact investors & venture philanthropists who want a social return only
- Small and mid-level investors willing to directly invest in vetted projects
- Other?
# 8. TFI Governance
## 8.1. Board of Directors
Comprised of members of all levels of the Threefold ecosystem- foundation, ambassadors, farmers, investors representative, and invited expert/s in social impact investing. The Board approves policy, and selection measurement, and implementation criteria. Ensures reporting to stakeholders, that CSR activities are properly undertaken.    
## 8.2. CSR Committee
Formulates CSR policy, criteria for provider partner and project eligibility, policy and structures for measurement and assessment (IXO) etc. Ensures reporting to stakeholders and oversee stakeholder relations.    
## 8.3. CSR Implementation Team
Operations. Communication and coordination with provider partners, monitor and report on progress, ensure implementation of budget, etc.    
  
**Note: Structure can be simplified depending on the legal structure chosen, and whether the following tools and impact measurement partnerships can be implemented. A smaller governing board can work with a Board of Advisors.*    
  
### 9. TFI Investor Portfolio 
- Institutional funds
- High networth individuals
- Family offices
- CSR Funds
- Philanthropic Funds
  
xxx    
### 9. TFI Risks
- New Technology: the fact that the tech underpinning this TFF movement is so new with limited track record will pose some concern for investors. HOwever, this will be addressed over time and hence showcase projects are key to this point
- Market factors - macro and micro risk economics (see: market analysis)
- Track Record: the fact that TFF is a new movement with limited track record will have some adverse effect on the investor evaluation on risk. Key to this is the development of a showcase inclusive of some startup projects funded by TFF as the seed investor to demonstrate feasibility and progress
- TF Token value, liquidity and volatility
# 10. TFI Goals & Timelines
  
- TFI Investor Funnel (incl an array of first round target investors):	June 2018 (end)
- TFI Project Funnel (incl no less than 10 pre-qualified projects):  	July 2018 (end)
